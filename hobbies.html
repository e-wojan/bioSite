			<h2>Dorothy's Hobbies</h2>
			</br>
			<p>Dorothy has always had an appreciation for nature and a love of books. As such, her primary hobbies in life have been gardening, birding, and reading.</p>
			</br>
			<p>While she does not spend her time gardening anymore, when she was younger she always made sure to plant a vegetable garden at her home that she could spend time tending too.</p>
			</br>
			<p>As for birding and reading, those are the two hobbies that she invests most of her time into these days. She loves to take time each day to watch the birds around her home and see if she can identify any of  the species that she sees. During the evening is when she primarily finds herself reading and her favorite genre has always been romance.</p>
